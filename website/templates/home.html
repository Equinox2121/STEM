                    <p><b><i>Participants:</i></b> The community service requirement for this academic program is designed
                        to encourage character development, civic engagement, and practical, real-world experience in STEM-related
                        fields. The service component supports program and classroom goals by involving students directly in their
                        local STEM communities. Students who participate are expected to document their service through a service
                        log and a written activity report describing their contributions. Community service is defined as a
                        voluntary contribution of time and/or effort to support school or community members and may be completed
                        during the academic year, summer break, or holiday periods. Students may fulfill this requirement through
                        a variety of opportunities, including family-supported volunteering, youth organizations, or independent
                        service activities. All service experiences should have a clear connection to STEM.</p>

                    <p>Students may begin accumulating service hours upon entry into the program. All required service must be completed
                        by a specified deadline during the student’s graduating year. A community service log must be submitted along with a corresponding
                        activity report for each service activity listed. Students are responsible for ensuring that each activity includes
                        a clear application of STEM principles and receives approval from an appropriate instructor or program supervisor.</p>
