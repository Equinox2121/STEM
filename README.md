# Overview
- This is a nearly finished prototype of a community service tracking website built specific for a STEM Program. It consists of a full register/login system and allows participants to input and view their own service hours.

## Important Notes
- The custom backend dashboard for STEM administrators was not completed in time, but all the information could be viewed using a third party hosting/database platform.
- Mobile compatibility has not been implemented; the interface was specifically designed for desktop viewing only.

## Privacy Modifications
- Some files and data have been removed or modified to protect privacy before public posting.
